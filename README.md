# FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certificate Projects:
This repository shows my own solutions for the projects of the scientific computing with python course on FCC.

***Some important things to note:***
* The files **main.py** , **test_module.py** , and **README.md** inside all directories are all uploaded from the starter code provided for us by FCC, so the other files are my real work, saying this just for honesty purposes.
* My code may not be the most efficient code (*I mean here the complexity of the code, the code is working well but i really like to see the contributions of other people when it comes to minimizing the execution time*), so if you can optimize it i'm welcoming all pull-requests.
